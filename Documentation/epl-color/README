vim syntax coloring for epl source code.

The basic file is epl.vim which should be
copied to /usr/share/vim/.../syntax/
and then you should edit /usr/share/vim/.../filetype.vim
and add the .pe extension.

This may not work right away. Some operators are highlighted
and some are plain white. If you are on a virtual terminal
console you can also try out mycolors.vim, which in combination
with epl.vim will give you the best visual effect.
