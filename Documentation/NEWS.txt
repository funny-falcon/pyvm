1.2 (30-Apr-2006)
=================

* EPL Whitespaceless frontend. Documentation/EPL.txt, Lib/epl.py

* Included zlib in the source tree for static build.

* Memfs and freezing. See Stuff/FreezeLab

* "Regular Expression to C" module and just in time compiler.
   Lib/rejit/

* Pythonic ELF loader (experimental).

* New bytecode format (incompatible with python). This has magic
  number 62054 and can be used for trying our new features.
  Such a feature is the 'Global Names Tuple' which reduces the
  size of the .pyc file.

* Ported to cygwin. Cygwin is not a development target. We
  are basically interested in being able to provide frozen binaries
  for windows users. That works, but there are warnings and hair.

* Fixes, improvements.  There was a stupid error in the code
  generation and the size of the pyvm executable was almost two
  times bigger.  Now the real net-weight of pyvm in x86 is 390K.


1.1 (23-Jan-2006)
=================

* Real lighweight threads. There are two OS threads. The
  'main thread' which runs the stackless VM and the 'polling thread'.
  In case of a blocking call, the main thread sends a request
  to the polling thread and removes the Task from the running list.
  When there is activity on the file descriptor, the polling thread
  notifies the main thread that if should put the task back on the
  running list.
  The effect of this is that we can run a multithreaded server with
  thousands of python threads with just 3 OS threads.

  This happens only for: time.sleep, socket.connect, socket.accept
  and socket.recv.  Other blocking calls will use OS threads from
  the 'thread pool' (possibly still OS threads < Py threads).
   
* faryield. See faryield.txt

* Included the wiki software (pyvm + SimpleHTTPServer + webpy + parawiki).
  Stuff/wiki

* Many bugfixes.
