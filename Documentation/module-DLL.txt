Module DLL
==========

The DLL module is used to wrap OpenGL, SDL, ...
This document is useful for further hacking these libraries
or adding new libraries.


INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DLL module is something between the dl-module and the ctypes-module.
It allows us to wrap functions from C libraries at runtime.

It is more advanced than the dl-module, which is barely usable.
It is less complicated than ctypes which, um, implements C types,
 structures, global variables, etc.

The DLL module can only wrap functions but also takes care of argument
conversions, return values, releasing the GIL, etc.

An introductory example:

	import DLL
	libc = DLL.dllopen ('libc.so')
	mytime = libc.get (('', 'time', 'i'))
	print mytime (0)

Here the C function 'time' from the Dynamic Library 'libc' is
wrapped behind the python object 'mytime'.


CJIT
~~~~

With the DLL module we can create C code to speed up some operations.
We do that by compiling C code at runtime and then linking this code
to our python application.  Technique also known as 'Just In C Time'
The idea is not entirely new since this is also possible in CPython
with 'weave' and 'pyinline', (although not standard).

Some theory:

	So, how fast is the bytecode?
	That depends.  It actually depends on the cost of the operation
	versus the cost of the execution of one opcode.
	For example in

		D1.update (D2)

	if the dictionaries D1 and D2 have thousands of keys then 99.9%
	of the time will be spent in updating the dictionary and only 0.1%
	in the bytecode vm.  Therefore this is an operation that we want
	to do in bytecode.  The C version of the same thing would not be
	any faster (in fact it could be slower due to code cache misses).

	A sample case where bytecode is weak is arithmetic operations.
	If x,y,z are all floating point numbers, then:

		x = (-0.25*x-25.0*y)/(z*z)

	needs about 10 bytecode instructions.
	In this case the bytecode version is very inefficient compared to
	the C version of the same formula.

So this is the application of the CJIT:

	import os, DLL

	PROGRAM = r"""
		double formula (double x, double y, double z)
		{
			return (-0.25*x-25.0*y)/(z*z);
		}
	"""
	file ('tmpfile.c', 'w').write (PROGRAM)
	os.system ('gcc -fpic -O3 -shared tmpfile.c -o mylib.so')
	mylib = DLL.dllopen ('./mylib.so')
	myformula = mylib.get (('d', 'formula', 'ddd'))

	print myformula (1.1, 2.2, 3.3)

Of course, with this approach, the C code cannot call back to
pyvm functions and therefore it can't manipulate lists, tuples,
dictionarys and generally python objects.  But this is good!
This is "THE BARRIER" between what should be done in python and what
should be done in C.  If the CJIT had access to the C API of its
python implementation, it would:

	1) depend on it and therefore wouldn't be useful for
	   other python implementations
	2) people would be tempted to do everything in C

With CJIT, users are encouraged to structure their code in such
a way that it exposes possibilities to use CJIT.

	(C is a beautiful and easy language after all.	/runs)

	#######---------------Benchmark-----------------------
	import os
	import DLL

	# The function DLL.CJIT will compile and dynamically link a C program

	formula = DLL.CJIT (r"""
		double f (double x, double y, double z)
		{
			return (-0.25*x-25.0*y)/(z*z);
		}
	""").get (('d', 'f', 'ddd'))

	def f1 ():
	    global R
	    x, y, z= 1.1, 2.2, 3.3
	    f = formula
	    for i in xrange (1000000):
		R = f (x, y, z)

	def f2 ():
	    global R
	    x, y, z= 1.1, 2.2, 3.3
	    for i in xrange (1000000):
		R = (-0.25*x-25.0*y)/(z*z)

	from time import time
	t0=time()
	f1()
	print time()-t0
	t0=time()
	f2()
	print time()-t0
	###########-------------------------------------------------

When we run this we get:

0.80
0.90

Not a big deal, but you can try the fibonacci numbers for something
more impressive.

- CJIT of course requires the existance of a C compiler.  Not all systems
  have such a program.  We can provide alternative implementations in
  python if the C compiler is not present.


MORE CJIT - strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can pass python strings to CJIT functions.  A convention that can
be taken for granted is that all python strings are null terminated.
(no mention to unicode yet)

Suppose that we want a function called 'lowlet' which will return true
if all the characters of a string are low case ASCII characters.
Here is how with the DLL module.

	import os
	import DLL

	lowlet = DLL.CJIT (r"""
		int lowlet (char *s)
		{
			while (*s)
				if (*s < 'a' || *s > 'z') return 0;
				else ++s;
			return 1;
		}
	""").get (('i', 'lowlet', 's'))

	print lowlet ('thisisok')
	print lowlet ("this ain't")


THE GIL
=======

By default C functions are called with the Global Interpreter Lock
held.  That means that if the C function blocks and our python
program is multithreaded, no other threads will run until the C
function returns.  A blocking call is something like sleep().

Another reason to release the GIL is that the C routine does a lot
of processing and we want to take advantage of multi-processor
architectures.

The method 'get' of the dllObject has a second argument whos default
value is False.  If set to True, the function will be considered
blocking and the GIL will be released and reaquired when the C function
is called.  An example of a blocking call:

	import os
	import DLL
	import thread

	mylib = DLL.CJIT (r"""
		#include <stdio.h>
		void sleepus ()
		{
			sleep (10);
		}
	""")

	sleepus = mylib.get (('', 'sleepus', ''), True)

	def forevah ():
	    # releasing the GIL makes sense in multithreaded
	    # programs.  This is another thread which keeps
	    # printing "Hi!"
	    while 1:
		for i in xrange(2000000):
		    pass
		print "Hi!"

	thread.start_new_thread (forevah, ())
	time.sleep (1)
	print "SLEEP SOME MORE"
	sleepus ()
	print "OKIE DOKIE"

The effect that we want to see when we run this program is that
while the system call sleep() is called, our interpreter takes the
oportunity to run the other thread which prints "Hi!".
If the GIL is not released, this will not happen.

Calling functions that release the GIL is slower.  For one releasing
and reaquiring the GIL costs a bit and in the case of our first
benchmark where we want to speed up arithmetic operations, this cost
is significant.  Secondly, if a C function is considered blocking,
then the cost of the call is not important.  Such calls are not
optimized for speed unlike the GIL-holding version which is as
fast as possible.


CALLBACKS
=========

Some times when we are wrapping C libraries, we want to attach
callbacks that call back to our interpreter.  For example, the
function

	void glKeyboardFunc (void (*f)(int,int,int));

which registers a callback function that will be called whenever
a key is pressed.  Let for the purpose of our documentation
create such a library function which calls its callback immediately:

	PROGRAM = r"""
		void call_f (void (*f) ())
		{
			f ();
		}
	"""
	mylib = DLL.CJIT (PROGRAM)
	call_f = mylib.get (('', 'call_f', 'i'))


Our goal now is to pass "something" to call_f that will eventually
call a python function from our python program.

The DLL module provides a (currenly simple) callback factory which
generates functions without requiring the compilation of any C code.
Pointers to these functions can be passed and called from C code and
call back into our interpreter.

We start by creating a callback:

	my_callback = DLL.Callback (('', ''))	# takes no args, returns void

Now 'my_callback' is an allocated "callback object".
We can register its python callable:

	def foo():
	    print "I exist!"

	my_callback.set_callback (foo)

And we can pass its C pointer to the C library:

	call_f (my_callback.fptr ())

This last statement, calls the C function call_f, which calls its callback
pointer to function 'f', which calls our callable object 'my_callback' which
calls the registered function 'foo'.

The value returned by my_callback.fptr() is always the same and independent
of the registered function.  So the glKeyboardFunc wrapper would be something
like this:

	KeyBoard = Callback (('', 'iii'))
	glKeyboardFunc (KeyBoard.fptr ())

	KeyBoard.set_callback (...)


The Callback mechanism automatically takes care of any GIL issues;
- if call_f was called with the GIL held then calling back into the
vm is done without caring about the GIL.
- if call_f was called in blocking mode then the callback object will
aquire the GIL before performing the callback.

Callback objects are never released.


ARRAYS
======

These are C functions that take a pointer to a {char, short, int,
long, float, double}.  Suppose such a library function 'fsum' which
takes a pointer to an array of floats, their count and returns their
sum:

	PROGRAM = r"""
		float fsum (float *X, int n)
		{
			float ret = 0;
			while (n--)
				ret += *X++;
			return ret;
		}
	"""

	mylib = DLL.CJIT (PROGRAM)
	fsum = mylib.get (('f', 'fsum', 'pfi'))

("pfi" is "pointer to float, int")

What can we pass to these functions.

1) Lists and tuples.  For example:

	VALS = 1.1, 2.2, 3.3
	print fsum (VALS, len (VALS))

2) arrays from the 'array module'.  In fact this is a great application
   of the array module.  First an example:

	from array import array
	VALS = array ('f', [1.1, 2.2, 3.3])
	print fsum (VALS, len (VALS))

   When we pass arrays it's like passing the argument "by reference";
   If the C function modifies the values of the array the changes are
   updated in the array object.  On the other hand, when we pass a list
   or a tuple, it is converted to an array, the array is passed to
   the function and then it is destroyed.  So any changes are not
   updated in the list.  This is like "call by value" and it's also
   much slower because a new array is constructed and all the elements
   of the list are copied over to it.

An example of a C function that modifies the values of an array:

	PROGRAM = r"""
	void finc (float X[], int n)
	{
		int i;
		for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
			X [i] *= 2.0;
	}
	"""

	mylib = DLL.CJIT (PROGRAM)
	finc = mylib.get (('', 'finc', 'pfi'))

	VALS = array ('f', [1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
	print VALS
	finc (VALS, len (VALS))
	print VALS

arrays can also be used if we want to get multiple values from a C function.


FORMAT OF get
=============

At last!  We get to see the format for the 'get' function.
The first parameter of 'get' is a tuple of three strings.
	1) The return type string
	2) The symbol name in the dll
	3) The argument types specification

Note that the format of get is NOT 64-bit ready. Use common sense for now.

The following characters can be used for the argument types:

'i':	'int'. Integer and more generally something as big as a CPU
	register.  32 or 64 bits depending on the architecture.
	Also sizeof (int)==sizeof (void*), so for functions that
	get a pointer argument we can use the 'i' format.

	This format should also be used for functions that take
	a "char" or "short int" argument.  In C calling conventions
	all these are passed as ints.

	Valid Python Objects: Only python integers may be passed.

'f':	'float' arguments.
	Valid Python Objects: integers and floats

'd':	'double' arguments.
	Valid Python Objects: integers and floats

's':	'char*' arguments.
	Valid Python Objects: Only Strings.  A pointer to the characters
	of the string object is passed.  Strings are mutable in C!

'p8':	'char*'
'p16':	'short int*'
'p32':	'int*'
'p64':	'long long*'/'long*'
'pf':	'float*'
'pd':	'double*'
	Valid Python Objects: 
		- arrays of 'c', 'h', 'i', 'f' and 'd' respectively
		  passed by reference.
		- lists and tuples. converted to arrays.
		- especially for 'p8' we can also pass a string object

'pv':	p32 or p64 depending on the architecture

'v':	'void*' generic pointer.
	Valid Python Objects: Integers, Strings, any array

For the return value, we can use the strings:
'':	no return value
'i':	integer (char, short, int) or generally register size (can be pointer)
'f':	float
'd':	double
's':	copy string. the real return value of the function must be 'char*' and it
	must point to a NULL-terminated string which will be *copied* to a new
	python string. If the string is not NULL-terminated or you don't want to
	copy into a python string, use 'i' instead to treat the return value as
	a general purpose pointer. 's' should not be used if the wrapped function
	may return NULL! In that case use 'i', check that it is non zero and
	use the function DLL.Strcpy() to make a python string.

There is no support for functions returning structures.

In the case of Callback, the types of the arguments are
reversed: The callback arguments can be 'ifds' and the return
type of the callback can be 'ifdsp*v'.

Q: What about signed/unsigned?
A: Doesn't make any difference.  These specifiers are about the size of
   the argument.  Signess does not matter to the API of C functions.

Q: These are not user friendly!
A: Yes. But the user friendly part should be done in python.  These are
   what the internal C implementation of the module provides.

Q: Wouldn't it be nice if DLL could read header files and extract the
   function definitions itself?
A: It certainly would! That is in the TODO list (although lower priority)
   but for some really huge apps like GTK (4000 functions), it's better
   to use custom specialized tools for this. Moreover it would be better
   to generate 'API specs' from header files once so that users won't have
   to download the entire 40MB GTK toolchain just so the wrapper will work.
   In other words, we'd rather generate the API and distribute it inside
   pyvm in a form which is more convenient than C headers.

Q: What about C++?
A: Forget about it.  C++ has its own name mangling rules.  In order to
   wrap C++ function we need a C++ compiler and the entire translation
   unit of the header files!  One solution would be to use the tools
   'nm' and 'c++filt'.  However, C++'s name mangling is not standarized
   and different C++ compilers will generate libs with different names.

Q: What about multidimensional arrays?
A: Arrays of arrays are generally ok.  Arrays of pointers are not.

Q: Isn't this dangerous because it can segfault the VM?
A: Yes it is. On the other hand if people want to extend python with
   C libraries they will write C code anyway and therefore the
   segmentation faults can happen there. Because the C API is more
   scary and may discourage people who are not careful from doing
   this is not an excuse. If somebody doesn't feel comfortable with
   C they shouldn't use the DLL module and CJIT!
