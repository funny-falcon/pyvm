This is a rewrite of python's tkinter.c in python using the DLL
module to wrap libtcl. We also need "tcl.h" in order to extract
values from structures using code compiled at runtime using DLL.

This works only for non-threaded tcl 8.4

Other versions/systems will need extra hacking.

This version was written to test the proof of concept of the
DLL module for wrapping libraries: it works!
