Known Bugs


- Unicode encoding.
  If a comment like:
	#! -*- coding: koi8-r -*-
  is found at the beginning of a line, something happens and pycparser
  does not encode unicode strings properly.

  I know nothing about unicode, and I can't fix it.
  see the file Lib/test/test_pep263.py

- Only the DFA parser can do assignment-expressions.
  Known bug of the DFA parser is that it can't do:

	x[:,2]	# problem with the comma after the colon
