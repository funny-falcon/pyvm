First of all, pyvm does not use this directory to import modules.
It uses ../Public which has links to the .pyc files of this tree.

So if you modify anything you have to type, 'make' before it
works as a standard library module.


BOOTSTRAPPING:

In order to bootstrap we store the critical .pycs in image.tar
and unpack this and recompile. Right now the pyc compiler also
uses 're', 'itertools', 'posix' and 'os' so we need the pycs of
these in order to boot.
