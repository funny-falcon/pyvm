regular expressions to C
------------------------

The functionality of this module is very limited.
Although only ~40% of the features of regular expressions
are supported, (no anchors, backreferences, repetition on repetition)
it is still good since jitting regexps would be done
on selected cases, and these cases can be written in such
a way that can be jitted.

Regular expressions are algorithms and writting regexps
is programming and therefore arranging to JIT them is part
of the deal (as well as hacking rejit and looking at the
generated C code, and the assembler output).

Usually, it doesn't make sense to JIT small regular expressions.
For
	R = re.compile ('\w+\d')
it's better to leave it to pcre; re2c won't be any faster and
you'll fill memory with shared libaries.
re2c can give a 20%-30% speedup for more complex regexes.

For really big regular expressions like a C tokenizer, re2c
can reach a 40%-50% speedup.
