Twilight GUI is freeware.

Importing a wrapper on the other hand, means that the wrapped toolkit is
also imported.  For that, you should see the license of each toolkit.
For example, PyQT is a GPL'd library which means it can't be used by
non-GPL code.  Therefore, if you wish to use Twilight GUI in software
which is not compatible with the GNU GPL, you are not supposed to import
'wrap_pyqt.py'.

For the license of each toolkit, please see:

- PyGTK
  http://www.pygtk.org/
  LGPL

- PyQT
  http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/
  GPL

- wxPython
  http://www.wxpython.org/
  GPL + blanket permission to link it in any kind of program

- Tkinter
  http://www.python.org
  Python License

If, a malicious user, renames 'wrap_pyqt.py' to 'wrap_tkinter.py'
and renders the application with QT despite your intentions, you
are, of course, not responsible.
