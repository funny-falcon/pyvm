The twilight gui was released in September 2004 but never
got an "Ok lets do this!" proclamation and its development
was halted at the time.

In November 2005 twilight GUI was resurrected as standard
part of the pyvm toolchain. It can still be distributed
independently. You are allowed to take the wrap_*.py files
and include them in your own project and use them with
python. They are in the domain of the public.
