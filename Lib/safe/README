did you break the bootstrap?
hopelessly fatal breakage?

python to the rescue:
- Go up, type 'make clean'
- From this dir type 'python Make.py'
- Go to ../pyc and do 'python test_bootstrap.py'
- Go to .. and 'make image'

To test if it's fixed,
Go .. and 'make clean; make bootstrap'

(how can one break the bootstrap:
if you modify any of the modules 're', 'posix', 'os', etc
in a way that they are incompatible with how pyc uses them
and then you forget to 'make image' before 'make bootstrap',
voila. broken because the 'image' has the incompatible pycs)

### Generally, if the bootstrap is VERY broken (BIOS broken, etc)
the trick is to run only .pyc files, never invoke the pyc compiler
and use python for compiling sources. pyvm development without
Python is not possible.
