About this wiki
---------------

This is a very simplistic wiki engine which is based
on:

*  Python (pyvm runtime, [stats](/special/stats.html))
*  BaseHTTPServer -- everything in memory
*  the [web.py](http://webpy.org) micro-framework (modified)
*  Markdown (add link) typesetting
*  the rediculously simple, [parawiki](/special/site.py) engine

How does it work
----------------

Anybody can *edit* the *cache*. Those who know the password can
*commit* the cache to *head*. If you submit modifications but in
the meanwhile the page has been modified, your modifications will
be **lost** ("first to commit wins").

Another interesting approach is the concept of the *distributed wiki*.
That is that you start your own wiki server (the *local* wiki)
and then edit this wiki (*remote* wiki) just to link to the content
of *your* wiki. And then others edit your wiki to add links to
*their* wiki, etc, etc... On the other hand this may never happen!
