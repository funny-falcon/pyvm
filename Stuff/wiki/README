Very Simple Wiki
================

This wiki is a useful application of pyvm. It's based on:

	- pyvm stackless runtime
	- Multithreading BaseHTTPServer
	- web.py micro framework
	- site.py wiki engine
	- python markdown.py

Because pyvm is stackless, this server can handle thousands
of requests (python threads) with just 3 OS threads and that
makes it perfect for people who have a restricted, non-root
unix account. And the performance may be quite good as well.

Also, if we compile an optimized-for-size pyvm binary and include
all the necessary .pyc files and a minimized libc and a specially
compiled kernel, we can have wiki-in-a-floppy, which is something
extremely useful and many people have been anxiously waiting for
it for a long time!


In the future everybody will write their own wiki engine?
