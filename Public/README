This is mirroring of the pyc files of Lib.

Don't remember why I did it.

It looks neat but if you modify a .py file from Lib it
WILL NOT be automatically recompiled.

Hmmm.

Advantages:

1. the pyc compiler is supposed to be optional and consequently
   python syntax too. pyvm cares about pyc-files. Public provides
   abstraction.
2. Lib is the development directory and has other .pyc files
   (testcases, scripts, programs, etc). Standard library users
   shouldn't have access to these.
3. It's cleaner to freeze pyvm (pyvm binary + interesting pycs).
