applications
============

several apps that are found in pyvm's library but are useful even
as standalone applications.

indent.py:	reindent python source code with tabs-only or spaces-only
pycc.py:	run the pyc compiler to covert .p[ye] to .pyc
re2c.py:	convert regular expressions to C (pyvm only)
